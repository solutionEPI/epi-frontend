Django Modern Admin is an open-source project that provides a sleek, modern, and highly customizable administrative interface for Django projects, built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. It aims to replace the standard Django admin with a more user-friendly and feature-rich frontend, while still leveraging the power and flexibility of Django's backend.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern UI**: A beautiful and responsive interface built with Next.js and the best-in-class shadcn/ui component library.
- **Dynamic Model Views**: Automatically generates list, create, and edit views for your Django models.
- **AI-Powered Generation**:
  - **Content Generation**: In any model's form view, use the "Generate with AI" button to populate fields based on a natural language prompt. The system is smart enough to understand your model's schema for accurate data creation.
  - **AI Utilities**: A dedicated "AI Tools" section with utilities like a secure password generator.
- **Customizable**: Configure navigation, model display, and more through simple configuration files.
- **Dark Mode**: Supports light and dark themes.
- **Internationalization**: Ready for multi-language support with next-intl.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Creating Your Own Admin Dashboard

This project is a template that can be used to generate a new, customized admin dashboard. The easiest way to get started is with `degit`.

1.  **Scaffold Your Project**

    Run the following command in your terminal. This will create a new directory (`your-project-name`) with a clean copy of the template.

    _Replace `your-github-username/django-modern-admin` with the actual path to this template repository on GitHub._

    ```bash
    npx degit your-github-username/django-modern-admin your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Navigate and Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    cd your-project-name
    npm install
    ```

    This step is necessary to install `inquirer`, which the setup script uses for its interactive prompts.

3.  **Run the Interactive Setup**

    This command starts a script that will ask you for your project's details and automatically update all the necessary files (`package.json`, `README.md`, etc.).

    ```bash
    node setup.js
    ```

    Follow the prompts. Once it's done, the setup script will delete itself to keep your project clean.

4.  **Final Configuration**

    - **`.env.local`**: Create this file by copying `.env.example`. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to point to your Django backend and add your `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY`.
    - **Branding**: Replace `public/logo.svg` and `public/favicon.ico` with your own assets.
    - **Commit**: Commit the initialized project files to your own repository.

5.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
